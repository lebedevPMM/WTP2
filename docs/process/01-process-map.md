## Key Principles

1. **No corporate setup before banking confirmation** — bankability determines the path
2. **Risk verdict before commitment** — no engagement letter without pre-screen
3. **Partner is always informed** — weekly updates minimum
4. **Document everything** — all decisions logged in CRM
5. **SLA compliance** — response within 4 hours, pre-screen within 7 days
