# LinkedIn Pinned Post #2 — What We Don't Do

---

## Post Text

What WTP doesn't do:

We don't guarantee bank accounts.
We don't promise "fast-track" visas with no questions asked.
We don't accept every client who has money to spend.
We don't bypass compliance because someone is in a hurry.
We don't go around the referring partner. Ever.

Here's what we do instead:

1. We verify bankability first. Before any company is formed, we confirm whether the client can actually open a bank account. This saves everyone time, money, and reputation.

2. We classify risk. Every client gets a pre-screen: Green (proceed), Yellow (conditions), Red (decline). No exceptions.

3. We decline when we should. If a profile has sanctions exposure, unresolvable SOF gaps, or pressure to skip compliance — we say no. Clearly and quickly.

4. We protect the partner. Your clients stay yours. Tagged in CRM, no direct outreach, contractual terms.

This approach means we process fewer cases than mass-market providers. But the cases we process get done right.

If you want an execution partner in the UAE that filters for quality — not volume — reach out.
