# LinkedIn Pinned Post #1 — Who We Are

## Post Text

We're WTP — a UAE execution partner for brokers and advisors.

Here's what that means:

When your client needs a company in the UAE, a bank account, a visa, or a tax residency strategy — we handle the entire delivery. On the ground. Start to finish.

You keep the relationship. We do the work.

What makes us different:

→ Banking-first. We confirm bankability before any setup begins. No wasted effort, no "guaranteed accounts" that don't materialize.

→ Risk-aware. We decline clients who don't meet compliance standards. 3-tier classification: Green (proceed), Yellow (conditional), Red (decline). We say no when we should.

→ Partner protection. Your clients stay yours. CRM-tagged, no direct engagement without your permission, clear commission terms.

→ Structured delivery. 10-stage process from intake to ongoing support. Clear checkpoints. Weekly reporting.

We're based in DIFC, Dubai. We work with wealth managers, immigration advisors, family offices, and brokers across Europe, CIS, and MENA.

If you refer clients to the UAE and want an execution partner you can trust — let's talk.
