## Post Text

How we helped a European entrepreneur open a corporate bank account in Dubai — after two rejections.

(Anonymized case. Details composited for privacy.)

**The situation:**

A wealth manager in Zurich referred a client — a tech entrepreneur with a €3M+ annual business, looking to relocate to the UAE.

The client had already tried twice:
- Company formed through a "fast-track" provider 6 months ago
- Applied to two major banks. Rejected both times.
- No one had explained why.

The company was registered. The visa was in process. But without a bank account, the entire structure was useless.

The partner asked us: can you fix this?

**What we found:**

We ran our standard pre-screen:

→ Risk classification: YELLOW (conditional)
→ Issue #1: Source of Funds documentation was incomplete — only personal statements, no business account history
→ Issue #2: The company was registered in a free zone that the target banks had restricted
→ Issue #3: No substance — no office, no employees, no UAE transactions

The previous provider had set up the company without checking bankability. Classic sequence error.

**What we did:**

1. **Re-assessed the banking scenario.** Identified 2 banks that accepted the client's profile and jurisdiction — different from the ones he'd been rejected at.

2. **Fixed the SOF package.** Requested: 12 months of business bank statements, audited financials, client letter explaining the business model. Took 2 weeks to compile.

3. **Added substance.** Arranged a flexi-desk office, prepared a board resolution, and documented the client's travel to UAE (biometrics, meetings).

4. **Coordinated the bank meeting.** Pre-submitted the complete package. Briefed the client on what to expect. Attended the meeting.

**The result:**

- Corporate bank account opened within 3 weeks of our engagement
- Personal premium account approved at the same bank
- Total engagement: Level 2 Setup — company restructured, banking resolved, visa completed
- Client is now operational and running transactions

**Time from partner referral to open account: 5 weeks.**

**The lesson:**

Banking in the UAE isn't about "connections" or "guaranteed accounts." It's about:

1. Knowing which bank accepts which profile
2. Preparing the right documentation package
3. Addressing compliance gaps before the meeting
4. Sequencing correctly: bankability first, setup second

If your clients are struggling with UAE banking — it's usually a preparation problem, not a bank problem.

We fix the preparation.

## Notes

- This is a composite case — not a single real client
- Based on typical patterns from WTP's case data
- Key message: sequence matters, preparation matters, "fast" providers cause problems
- Positions WTP as the fixer — the partner you call when it went wrong elsewhere
- Can be repurposed as: website case study, partner kit insert, sales conversation example
