## What is this project

WTP (Welcome to Paradise) is a B2B partner-facing website for a UAE execution partner. The site is designed for brokers, private bankers, advisors, family offices, and agencies outside the UAE who need a reliable on-the-ground operator in Dubai.

The website communicates the WTP value proposition: bankability, compliance, partner protection, and transparent delivery.
