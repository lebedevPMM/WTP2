# Rejection & Decline Templates

Standard responses for non-target, high-risk, or toxic client inquiries. All rejections must be professional, final, and documented in CRM.

## Template 1: Standard Decline — Risk Red Flag

**Subject:** WTP — Case Review Result

Dear [Partner Name],

Thank you for sharing the client profile for our review.

After conducting a thorough pre-screen assessment, we've identified issues that fall outside our current acceptance criteria. Specifically, the profile raised concerns in the following area(s):

- [Source of Funds documentation insufficient]
- [Sanctions-adjacent jurisdiction exposure]
- [Prior banking rejection history without remediation]

We are unable to proceed with execution for this case.

If the client can address the flagged items and provide supporting documentation, we're open to a re-assessment at a later date.

Best regards,
WTP Team

## Template 2: Decline — Toxic/Aggressive Request

**Subject:** WTP — Unable to Proceed

Dear [Partner Name],

Thank you for reaching out.

After reviewing the request, we've determined that this engagement does not align with our compliance framework and operating standards.

We are unable to proceed and will not be able to provide further detail on the specific reasons for this decision.

We appreciate your understanding.

Best regards,
WTP Team

## Template 3: Decline — Non-Target Profile (Wrong ICP)

**Subject:** WTP — Scope Mismatch

Dear [Partner Name],

Thank you for the referral.

After reviewing the client profile, we believe this case falls outside our core service scope. WTP is best suited for clients who need:
- UAE company formation with corporate banking
- Residency tied to a banking-first strategy
- Compliance-focused relocation for HNW individuals

For [mass-market visa processing / budget company formation / crypto-native structures without traditional banking needs], we'd recommend reaching out to a provider that specializes in this segment.

Happy to assist with future cases that align with our scope.

Best regards,
WTP Team

## Template 4: Conditional — Advisory Only

**Subject:** WTP — Advisory Recommendation

Dear [Partner Name],

We've completed the pre-screen for [Client Name / Reference].

The profile has been classified as **YELLOW** — meaning we can proceed with an advisory engagement, but full execution requires additional documentation or conditions to be met:

- [Condition 1: Provide certified SOF documentation]
- [Condition 2: Resolve pending tax residency status]
- [Condition 3: Obtain bank reference letter from current institution]

**Recommended path:**
1. Begin with a Level 0 Advisory engagement ($X)
2. Produce a feasibility roadmap with specific requirements
3. Reassess for execution once conditions are met

Shall we schedule the advisory phase?

Best regards,
WTP Team

## Template 5: Partner Decline — Behavior / Compliance Breach

**Subject:** WTP — Partnership Review

Dear [Partner Name],

Following our recent interactions, we need to address concerns regarding [specific behavior]:

- [Pressure to bypass compliance checks]
- [Requesting undocumented fee arrangements]
- [Sharing confidential client data outside agreed channels]

These practices conflict with WTP's operating standards and our Partner Protection Policy.

We are pausing all active cases under your referral until we can align on expectations. Please confirm your availability for a call this week.

If we cannot reach alignment, we will close the partnership channel formally.

Best regards,
WTP Team
