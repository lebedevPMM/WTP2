# Tone of Voice Guide

How WTP communicates — across the landing page, documents, emails, and LinkedIn.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Professional Calm
We don't oversell. We don't use exclamation marks in headlines. We state what we do clearly and let the quality speak.

**Do:** "We handle the full delivery cycle — from intent to outcome."
**Don't:** "We're the BEST execution partner in the UAE!!!"

### 2. Precision Over Persuasion
Every claim must be backed by a process, a checklist, or a policy. We don't make vague promises.

**Do:** "Banking scenario is confirmed before any setup begins."
**Don't:** "We guarantee you'll get a bank account."

### 3. Risk-Aware Honesty
We talk about what we decline as openly as what we accept. Saying "no" is part of our value.

**Do:** "We decline clients with unresolved sanctions exposure."
**Don't:** Avoid the topic or hide the rejection criteria.

### 4. Partner-Centric
The partner is our primary audience. Every piece of content should answer: "Why should I trust WTP with my client?"

**Do:** "Your client relationships remain yours."
**Don't:** "We work with end clients directly."

## Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Get to the point. No fluff, no corporate jargon | "We start with bankability, not paperwork." |
| **Confident** | We know our domain. No hedging, no "we think" | "The risk verdict determines the path." |
| **Respectful** | Never condescending, even when declining | "This profile doesn't meet our current criteria." |
| **Structured** | Use clear frameworks: numbered steps, tables, tiers | "3 risk levels: Green, Yellow, Red." |
| **Grounded** | Real examples over abstract claims | "23 completed cases, average revenue $12K." |

## Language Rules

### Headlines & Titles
- Sentence case (not Title Case or ALL CAPS)
- No exclamation marks
- Prefer verbs over nouns: "How we work" not "Our methodology"
- Max 8 words for section titles

### Body Copy
- Short paragraphs (2–3 sentences max)
- Active voice: "We verify" not "Verification is performed"
- Specific numbers over vague qualifiers: "$5,000–15,000" not "competitive pricing"
- Avoid superlatives: no "best," "leading," "premier," "unique"

### Lists & Bullet Points
- Start with a verb or noun, not an article
- Parallel structure within the same list
- No periods at the end of list items (unless full sentences)

## Tone by Channel

### Landing Page
Concise, scannable, structured. Heavy use of labels, pills, numbered steps. Minimal text per section.

### Partner Emails
Warm but professional. First name. Short paragraphs. Clear CTA at the end.

### LinkedIn
Thought leadership tone. Open with a hook (problem or insight). End with a question or clear takeaway. No hashtag spam (max 3).

### Internal Documents
Structured, precise, reference-friendly. Tables over paragraphs. Front matter with version and date.

### Rejection Communications
Respectful and final. No over-explaining. Offer advisory-only if applicable.

## Template Phrases

### Positive
- "This profile meets our criteria — we're ready to proceed."
- "Based on the pre-screen, we recommend the following scenario."
- "Your client's documentation is complete. Next step: banking scenario."

### Conditional
- "This profile requires enhanced controls — here's what we'll need."
- "We can proceed with advisory, but execution requires additional documentation."
- "The timeline may extend due to compliance requirements."

### Decline
- "After careful review, this profile doesn't meet our current acceptance criteria."
- "We're unable to proceed with execution. We recommend seeking a specialized provider."
- "We've flagged [specific issue]. We cannot accept this engagement."
