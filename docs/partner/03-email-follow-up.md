# Email Template — Follow-Up

For following up after initial outreach with no response, or after a positive first conversation.

---

## Version A: No Response to First Touch (Day 5–7)

**Subject:** Re: UAE execution — quick question

Hi [First Name],

Just following up on my note from last week. No worries if the timing isn't right.

If you'd like a quick look at how we work, here's our partner one-pager: [link or attachment]

The key idea: when your clients need UAE setup, we handle everything on the ground — you keep the relationship and earn commission. No minimum commitment.

Happy to chat whenever it makes sense.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Version B: No Response (Day 14 — Final Follow-Up)

**Subject:** Last note on UAE execution

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short — wanted to send one final note in case UAE execution is relevant for your clients at some point.

We're WTP — we handle company formation, banking, and residency in the UAE for brokers and advisors. Banking-first approach, clear risk policy, partner protection built in.

If it's not a fit right now, no problem at all. If a case comes up in the future, feel free to reach out: email@wtp.uae

All the best,
[Your Name]

## Version C: Post-Call Follow-Up (After Positive Conversation)

**Subject:** Next steps — WTP partnership

Hi [First Name],

Great speaking with you today. Here's a quick recap:

**What we discussed:**
- [Brief summary of conversation topics]
- [Specific client scenario or need mentioned]
- [Partnership model discussed: referral / white-label]

**Next steps:**
1. I'm sending our partner one-pager and process map (attached)
2. When you have a potential case, submit via [form link] or email — we'll do a free pre-screen
3. We can formalize the partnership terms after 1–2 pilot cases

No rush on the timeline — we're here when you have a case that fits.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Version D: Post-Pilot Follow-Up (After First Case)

**Subject:** How did it go? Next steps

Hi [First Name],

We've completed the [delivery / pre-screen] for [Client Reference]. Here's a quick summary:

- **Status:** [Delivered / In progress / Advisory completed]
- **Timeline:** [X weeks from submission to completion]
- **Outcome:** [Bank account opened / Company registered / Visa issued]

I hope the experience matched your expectations. A few questions:

1. Was the communication cadence sufficient?
2. Anything we should adjust for the next case?
3. Do you have other clients who might benefit from a similar setup?

If you're happy with the pilot, we can formalize the partnership terms — I'll send over the agreement draft.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Cadence Summary

| Touchpoint | Timing | Template |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| First touch | Day 0 | 02-email-first-touch.md |
| Follow-up #1 | Day 5–7 | Version A |
| Follow-up #2 (final) | Day 14 | Version B |
| Post-call | Within 24 hours | Version C |
| Post-pilot | Upon delivery completion | Version D |

**Rule:** Never send more than 3 outreach emails without a response. After Version B, move the lead to "Nurture" in CRM and revisit in 3 months.
