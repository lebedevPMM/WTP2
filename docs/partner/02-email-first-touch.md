# Email Template — First Touch

For initial outreach to a potential partner (broker, advisor, family office).

---

## Version A: Cold Outreach (LinkedIn → Email)

**Subject:** UAE execution — quick question

Hi [First Name],

I came across your profile on [LinkedIn / referral from X] — looks like you work with clients who may need UAE structuring.

We're WTP, an execution partner based in DIFC. We handle company formation, corporate banking, and residency for brokers and advisors — so you can focus on the advisory side without managing the logistics.

A few things that set us apart:
- **Banking-first approach** — we verify bankability before any setup
- **Your clients stay yours** — we don't go around partners
- **Risk-aware** — we decline profiles that don't meet compliance standards

If you ever get a client asking about UAE options, happy to do a free pre-screen to see if it's a fit.

No pressure — just wanted to make the connection.

Best,
[Your Name]
WTP | email@wtp.uae

## Version B: Warm Introduction (Mutual Contact)

**Subject:** [Mutual Contact] suggested we connect

Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Contact Name] mentioned you work with [HNW clients / international families / business owners] and thought we should connect.

We're WTP — a UAE execution partner for brokers and advisors. When your clients need company formation, banking, or residency in the UAE, we handle the full delivery.

The short version:
- You refer → we execute → you earn commission
- No operational burden on your side
- 4-stage process with clear checkpoints

I've attached our one-pager for reference. Happy to schedule a 15-min call to see if there's a fit.

Best,
[Your Name]
WTP | email@wtp.uae

## Version C: Event / Conference Follow-Up

**Subject:** Good meeting at [Event Name]

Hi [First Name],

Good to meet you at [Event Name] last [day]. I appreciated the conversation about [specific topic discussed].

As mentioned, WTP handles UAE execution for brokers and advisors — company formation, banking, residency — so you don't have to manage the ground operations.

If any of your clients are considering UAE, I'd be happy to do a free pre-screen. Attached is our partner one-pager with more detail.

Looking forward to staying in touch.

Best,
[Your Name]
WTP | email@wtp.uae
